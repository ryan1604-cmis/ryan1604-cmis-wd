				Lists and Links Assignment Description
			</h3>
			<p>
				This assignment is to teach us how to make lists and links in a webpage using HTML 5. We had to attach serveral related links to HTML help pages as well as make both ordered and unordered list with differing contents.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
				</li>
				<li>
					In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.
				</li>
				<li>
					In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
				</li>
				<li>
					Add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements.
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn in your work.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>
				Tables
			</h3>
			<p>
				The tables assignment teaches us to utilize the table function in html. We created a grid with numbers and calendar and a simple schedule. I learned how to use the colspan and rowspan elements to make a column or row last for more than its default value. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a new folder in your repository called "tables".
				</li>
				<li>
					In the "tables" folder, create a new file called from your template "index.html".
				</li>
				<li>
					Add html code to recreate the webpage below.
				</li>
				<ul>	<li>
						second table will require the use of the colspan attribute.
					</li>
					<li>
						third table will require the use of the rowspan attribute.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					In your repository index.html file, add an article with a heading, paragraph description and this list of requirements. Also add a link to the tables/index.html file. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Add a link from lists and links to this assignment as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Validate your code.	
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn it in.
				</li>
			</ul
